The style mimics the new Material You and the core components are based on the modern Android Architecture pattern with MVVM, Room, Retrofit, Kotlin...\nI'm planning to add new features such as new Widgets, dynamic colors, ARCore, and other cool Android frameworks in order to expand my knowledge of this platform.",

In this workshop I talked about different techniques that can be performed with public information about a target, and I did some PoCs with four tools developed in Telefonica with the goal of raise awareness about the misuse of information.\nThese four tools are Dirty Business Card, targeted to OSINT and Digital Identity, FOCA, that manages all the Metadata of a given domain, Air Profiling to profile the navigation of a phone and Airdrop Crazy to scan the environment to find Apple devices.\nWe had fun talking about all the modern threats that we could face on the Internet and how we could avoid some attacks. Have fun ;)",

Don't Push That Button is a dissemination channel (with the intention of being cross-platform) where you can post videos related to various branches of computing. All this came after reviewing my notes from my Computer Science's Degree, many of the things were very useful but I had not assimilated them well due to the rush and lack of overview. So my goal is that after watching each video, a person ends up knowing a little more about a technological topic and who knows how to relate it to other concepts.",

In addition, they also managed to see that in Airdrop the devices are enunciating the hash of the personal number to distinguish between friends and strangers.\nBased on this we have created a service and an app and we have taken the investigation to a new level, I hope you like it.",
